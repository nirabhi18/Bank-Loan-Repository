# Bank-Loan-Repository
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of a bank's loan performance, presenting key metrics and trends in an organized and visually appealing format. It includes three primary sections: the Summary, Overview, and Details dashboards. The Summary dashboard offers a high-level snapshot of total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, and the breakdown between good and bad loans, highlighting critical figures such as the average interest rate and debt-to-income ratio. The Overview dashboard delves into broader trends, such as the month-on-month increase in loan applications, state-wise distribution, and loan purposes, giving insights into borrower demographics and preferences. The Details dashboard provides granular information on individual loan applications, including specific data like interest rates, funded amounts, and loan grades, allowing for an in-depth analysis of each loan's performance. Together, these dashboards enable users to monitor and assess the bank's loan activities, track financial health, and identify areas for improvement.
